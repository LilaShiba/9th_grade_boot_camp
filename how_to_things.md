# Master Check List

Should everyone code? Who knows. That is a topic of debate! For this class, everyone will need to understand the basics of code. This, however, doesn't mean that everyone will code equally complex programs. You will need to meet with your teacher to figure out how much effort should be put into the how-to guides as balanced by how hard of a programming task you take on.

For example, if you are making a game that takes 25 hours to code you will just need to comment your code for the how-to. If you are making a game that takes 5 hours to program, your group will need to comment their code and create a more substantial how-to, such as a video.

Key take aways: 
- everyone will comment their code
- each groups' how-to will differ based on program complexity
- the how-to's are decided via a meeting with the teacher and group

**You should find the path that speaks most to you**

### Key Topics to Cover
These topics should be addressed in the corresponding how-to guides

- Data Types
- Variables
- Loops
- if/else
- User Input
- Logic Diagram
- Beta Testing
- Debugging


- Methods (how to create/use)
- Data Structures (how to create/use)

### Key How-To guide(s)
| Item                                        | Method         
| --------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Make guide for program from lab 0           | Can be commented code or video, game, etc
| Make guide for program from lab 1           | Can be commented code or video, game, etc

### Daily Ideas and Tasks
Your group should have a google doc that details what was done by whom for everyday of class. This is to track work, to make sure the work load is fair, and to keep a record of ideas. This isn't meant to be busy work or to take a long time. At the end of each class you will be given 5 mins to fill this out and to check the FAQ.

Your ideas are any thoughts- however strange- in connection with class and the end goal of this unit: creating a startup. By the time we get to the last lab you will have several ideas documented about what you want your startup to do, what role you want to play, and a deeper understanding of how your team works.

### Ways to make How-To Guides:
You are encouraged to be as creative as you can be. The list below is not definitive but merely suggestions
