# Master Check List

Should everyone code? Who knows. That is a topic of debate! For this class, everyone will need to understand the basics of code. This, however, doesn't mean that everyone will code equally complex programs. You will need to meet with your teacher to figure out how much effort should be put into the how-to guides as balanced by how hard of a programming task you take on.

For example, if you are making a game that takes 25 hours to code you will just need to comment your code for the how-to. If you are making a game that takes 5 hours to program, your group will need to comment their code and create a more substantial how-to, such as a video.

Key take aways: 
- everyone will comment their code
- each groups' how-to will differ based on program complexity
- the how-to's are decided via a meeting with the teacher and group

**You should find the path that speaks most to you**

### Key Topics to Cover
These topics should be addressed in the corresponding how-to guides

- Data Types
- Variables
- Loops
- if/else
- User Input
- Logic Diagram
- Beta Testing
- Debugging


- Methods (how to create/use)
- Data Structures (how to create/use)
