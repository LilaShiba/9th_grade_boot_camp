### How to Get User Input

In python, getting user data is rather simple. 
First, you want to create a variable to hold your users data:

```python

pizza = input("what type of pizza do you want?")

# when the program runs, the user will be prompted in the terminal to type in what pizza they want.
# The data will always come back in string form- even if they type a number

```
