![kiki](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/8802656768/h4ECC5C42/)

The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster. The Lean Startup method teaches you how to drive a startup-how to steer, when to turn, and when to persevere-and grow a business with maximum acceleration. It is a principled approach to new product development

#### Goals

**Prototype** You will have two functioning prototypes of your product or service. This can be a program, a working model, etc. The changes you made to improve your product are of the utmost importance.

**Pitch or Ted Talk** You will need to present your startup in a public forum. You may either pitch- with the goal of obtaining funding- or give a ted talk to convey the impact of your startup and its' mission.

#### MVP

Reading:
- [minimum viable product](http://ask.leanstack.com/lean-startup-fundamentals/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-mvp)

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development (wiki)

Go through your notes of ideas for your final product and create three POV statements with your group.
