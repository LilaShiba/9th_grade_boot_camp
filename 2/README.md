![kiki](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/8802656768/h4ECC5C42/)

The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster. The Lean Startup method teaches you how to drive a startup-how to steer, when to turn, and when to persevere-and grow a business with maximum acceleration. It is a principled approach to new product development

### Goals

**Prototype** You will have two functioning prototypes of your product or service. This can be a program, a working model, etc. The changes you made to improve your product are of the utmost importance.

**Pitch or Ted Talk** You will need to present your startup in a public forum. You may either pitch- with the goal of obtaining funding- or give a ted talk to convey the impact of your startup and its' mission.

# What Should I Make

What speaks to you? The only real goal of this unit is to empower you by teaching the skills needed to make an idea into reality. 
Some topics for this unit are as follows:

#### Astrobiology, the Power of Myth, and Colonization
- Latest scientific understanding of life & culture in the universe
- How to deal with science disbelievers and misinformation 
- Long term space travel, colonization, and terraforming
- Gain a galactic perspective
#### The Anthropocene and the Fate of Humanity
- Latest science of our current epoch and challenges to our survival
- The philosophy of ethics 
- How to deal with science disbelievers and misinformation
- Current political-economy
#### The UN Sustainable Goals
- [Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)
- Make the world better
- Continue project from last year

#### NYC Goals
- [nycgoals](https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/)

#### NASA Goals
- [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/about/whats_next.html)

Everyday, you will be thinking about and recording your ideas for what your startup will do. You may come up with your own topic, however, it needs to be approved by your teacher.

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedbac k for future product development (wiki)

- Go through your notes of ideas for your final product and choose a goal for your startup
- [Formulate an elevator pitch](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chicceo/2013/02/05/how-to-create-an-elevator-pitch/#761ac39861eb) of how you will meet your startup's goal
- Highlight three assumptions your startup has and
- Conduct three assumption [tests](https://github.com/kyle1james/9th_grade_boot_camp/tree/master/2#assumption-testing) documenting your interviews
- From your assumption testing notes, create three POV statements with your group
- Outline who will do what for creating the MVP
- Create one MVP with your group

Empathy interviews are the cornerstone of Design Thinking. Through ethnographic research techniques. 

- Once you have finished your MVP conduct a minimum of three empathy interviews: with the goal of conducting several
- Take notes during and after your MVP interviews
- Highlight three things you want to change based off of your empathy interviews
- Do you need to do more testing? Meet with a teacher to find out
- Outline who will do what for creating the second prototype
- Create the second prototype with your group

Before you decide what to build think about what assumptions are being made. After you’ve identified them… VALIDATE!!! If you’re a higher level manager, you should always ask, “What decisions associated with the product have been tested?” This will allow you to know how many assumptions have been validated in steps like the below.


# Presentations

**add rubric here**

#### Ted Talk

At TED, we search year-round for presenters who will inform and inspire, surprise and delight. Our presenters run the world's most admired companies and design its best-loved products; they invent world-changing devices and create ground-breaking media. They are trusted voices and convention-breaking mavericks, icons and geniuses [source](https://www.ted.com/about/conferences/speaking-at-ted).

TED isn't a typical conference. The TED audience has high expectations of the speakers; the TED speaker team works with speakers well in advance of the conference to help shape a presentation that will succeed on the TED stage. TED is the place to give the talk of your life [source](https://www.ted.com/about/conferences/speaking-at-ted).
