# Data Structures and Methods

**goal**: To design a program that uses data structures and methods

Roles: Remember the main [playlist](https://github.com/kyle1james/9th_grade_boot_camp/blob/master/README.md). While one or two of your teamates are programming, what else can you be doing?

### Bonus Questions
- what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation and show two ways either abstraction or encapsulation is done in python.
- find and fix the one programming error in this readme file
- team with most answers in the FAQ gets 5 bonus points
- team with best how-to for this lab and presents to class gets 5 bonus points

## What Are You Working On?
At the end of each class, document what each team member worked on.
