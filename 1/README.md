# Data Structures and Methods

**goal**: To design a program that uses data structures and methods

Roles: Remember the main [playlist](https://github.com/kyle1james/9th_grade_boot_camp/blob/master/README.md). While one or two of your teamates are programming, what else can you be doing?

### Bonus Questions
- what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation and show two ways either abstraction or encapsulation is done in python.
- find and fix the one programming error in this readme file
- team with most answers in the FAQ gets 5 bonus points
- team with best how-to for this lab and presents to class gets 5 bonus points

## What Are You Working On?
At the end of each class, document what each team member worked on.

- Is someone documenting/ creating the how-to program? 
- How is preparing for the debate coming along?
- Research, always research
- stuck on a programing question? Assign that TODO to one person and move along.

| Beta Test                                   | Have users try your program. Come up with how to make better
| Have first debate speech done	              | Test speech on two peers. Take notes on their constructive feedback

# Readings
These readings will help in your quest. For your language, make sure you know what and how to create/use methods and data structures. You will need to find your own sources as these two readings will not be enough.

For Data Structures:
#### python
readings:

- [what is a method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)
- [what are data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

Know:

- lists
- dictionary
#### p5js
The coding walk-a-long will answer most of your questions

- array
- hash
